# Master's Thesis - May 2022
Hi. It's Yasin. This repo contains my master's thesis file. It's a single Jupyter Notebook file, accompanied with explanations of code blocks. I studied my master's at University of Tehran, in Iran, and defended my thesis in May 2022.

This project was aimed at developing a data-driven tool with python for mineral potential mapping. This tool can be used by geoscientists who'd like to integrate several evidential layers of geochemical data. The method used here is based on a study by [Mahyar Yousefi and Emmanuel Carranza](https://doi.org/10.1016/J.CAGEO.2015.03.007). They have used Prediction-Area plots and Concentration-Area fractal analysis to classify and evaluate evidential maps. Their approach is semi-data-driven as there are still instances where the user has to arbitrarily navigate functions and set value to some variables.

I have tried to code their work with python. Python is an agile, efficient, and practical tool both for research and business. So, I chose python as my programming language of choice. I have tried to use easy-to-use libraries including `pandas`, `numpy`, `scipy`, and `matplotlib`, as much as possible so the user can easily use and modify the code. This program is my very first engagement with the world of programming as my prior academic studies were only limited to mining engineering. Please reach out via `issue` if you see any point for improving this piece for higher usability and readability.

## How to install and run the project?
As of this moment, this project is only available in a Jupyter Notebook, which is very much practical for novice users and researchers. In the future, this notebook will be developed into several scripts.

So, for now, you could just simply open the file and read, modify, and execute the code on spot.
