    "# Mineral Potential Mapping with Python - A Practical Tool\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, a simple but practical tool has been developed with python which helps with geochemical modelling. The core of all of the processes is based on an article by Mahyar Yousefi and Emmanuel Carranza <a name=\"cite_ref-1\"></a>[<sup>[1]</sup>](#cite_note-1). According to the article, assignment of weights to different classes of evidence in an evidential map is usually done through expert's opinion with some trial-and-error. In order to do this process in a data-driven way rather than using expert's opinion, a new method using prediction-area (P-A) plots and normalized density is introduced to determine weights of every single evidential map. In the following lines the literature disccused in the aforementioned work is programmed in Python.\n",
    "\n",
    "The programming language used in here is python. There are several reasons for the choice. The most important ones is that this language is agile and is easy to read and develop. Researchers can easily modify the code based on their needs.\n",
    "\n",
    "This program has been developed in three parts. The first Part, [Part 1](#Part1), is where all the preprocessing happens - from installing/importing the necessary libraries to statistical analysis of the data. The second Part, [Part 2](#Part2), is where the core of the processes has been programmed - gridding, mapping, PC analysis, Concentration-Area fractal modelling, descretizing, and Prediction-Area diagram drawing. The [final part](#Finalwords) is dedicated to discussion current issues with the code and suggestions for future development."
